## General Info
There is a need for a Rest (or Rest-like) API that can receive an index "n" and returns the Fibonacci value that corresponds to the given index: Only the first twenty-one numbers from the Fibonacci are being considered for this exercise, and stored as an array. Depending on the number 'n' entered by the user in the URL, the corresponding number in the sequence will be displayed. Since, in this case, the array contains only 21 numbers, if the user enters a greater 'n', they will receive an error message, that will be adequateaccording to the array's length.
