## General Info
There is a need for a Rest (or Rest-like) API that can receive an index "n" and returns the Fibonacci value that corresponds to the given index: Only the first twenty one numbers from the Fibonacci sequence are being considered for this exercise (index 0 to 20), and stored on a separate JSON file. Depending on the number 'n' entered by the user, the corresponding number in the sequence will be displayed. Since, in this case, the array contains only 21 numbers, if the user enters a greater 'n', they will receive an error message.

## Structure
- `/lib/index.html` - Simple HTML
- `/lib/script.js` - Functionality, management of DOM and API call
- `/lib/style.css` - Handle visibility of components
- `/sequence.json` - Fibonacci sequence

## Instructions
1. Run fake API REST server on http://localhost:3000/fibonacci on terminal
2. Open index.html on browser
3. Follow the instructions to find the Fibonacci number.
